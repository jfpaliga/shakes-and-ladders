# Shakes and Ladders

The [Shakes and Ladders](https://jfpaliga.github.io/shakes-and-ladders/) website is a page built for a board games store located in Nottingham. The website advertises
the store and provides information to potential customers.

External users of this website will be able to learn more information about the store, what they can do at the store and they can look at a calendar to
see future events taking place at the store. Users will also be able to browse a menu of milkshakes that are offered at the store and make a reservation
at the store through a booking form.

The goal for the owner of the site is to advertise the store and increase awareness, attract new customers and retain customers with interesting events and
to book out seats at the store to generate revenue.
